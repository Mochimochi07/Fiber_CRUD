# Fiber_CRUD
This is fiber crud app with json

This is my fiber crud app with json and no database.

I used owl city and his songs because owl city gave me nostalgia and calmness.

yea, the feels of getting high in daydreaming of random sweet things is a hooby of mine.

Well, i am a hootowl by the way and i loved some of those albums.

this is fiber golang by the way and it has something of an express like syntax. 

I'd still prefer the gin because of the tracking of handlers whenever people would just go use get/post/delete and update.

feel free to use this as a template for learning.
